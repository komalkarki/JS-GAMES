🚀 What is Game Hub?
Game Hub is a responsive, animated game portal where users can choose from five games, each targeting a different skill or logic style. It's designed to be fast, fun, and visually consistent—featuring premium UI/UX with a neon/dark theme.

🧠 The Games
🔴 Chaotic Clicker
A reaction game where you must click a teleporting button while being roasted. 30 seconds of chaos, laughter, and reflex-testing madness.

🎵 Echo Sequence
A memory game inspired by Simon Says. Watch and listen to a sequence of lights and tones—then try to repeat it. Each round adds difficulty.

⌨ Word Sprint
A typing-speed game. Words appear with a countdown bar—you must type them accurately before they vanish. Fail three times, and it's game over.

🎨 Color Thief
A visual memory challenge. A color is shown briefly, then hidden. Use RGB or HSL sliders to recreate it as accurately as possible.

🤥 Lie Detector
A trivia logic game. Decide if the displayed "fact" is true or false. Score based on your ability to separate real from ridiculous.
